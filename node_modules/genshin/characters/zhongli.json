    "description": "A mysterious guest invited by the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Extremely knowledgeable in all things. Zhongli does not bat an eyelid when paying (or when asking others to pay). He willingly pays the asking price, no matter how unreasonable it is, and may pay even more for things he likes. The funny thing is, Zhongli never remembers to take his purse with him.",
